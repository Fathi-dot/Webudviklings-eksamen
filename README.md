Project Overview:

This project is a skincare-themed website created as part of my Web Development exam.
The goal was to build a multi-section webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including navigation, images, product sections, and a footer.

The website includes:

A navigation bar with links

A large hero image with a call-to-action button

Product sections with images and text

A subscription form in the footer

Basic responsiveness for different screen sizes

This project helped me practice structuring a webpage and organizing content visually.

Technologies Used:
